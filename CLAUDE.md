# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Intelligence Interface codebase, originally forked from Intelligence Interface. It's evolving from a Go-based TUI application into a **self-evolving meta-system** where:
- **Caronex** serves as the central orchestrator managing the base system
- **User Spaces** are persistent desktop environments that evolve through conversation with Caronex
- **Agents** handle every capability with intelligence
- **Bootstrap Compiler** enables system self-improvement
- **Golden Repository** connects to collective intelligence

**Critical Distinction**: The TUI, agents, and tools are the BASE SYSTEM. Spaces are persistent DESKTOP ENVIRONMENTS that users build up and evolve over time, like macOS workspaces but with AI integration.

See `.claude/` directory for comprehensive meta-system documentation.

```

## Architecture Overview

### Space-Based Meta-System Architecture
- **Caronex Core**: Central orchestrator coordinating all system components
- **User Interface Space**: TUI/CLI/API agents providing adaptive user interaction
- **Agent Management Space**: Dynamic agent spawning, coordination, and evolution
- **Data Management Space**: Session, memory, and cache agents with persistence
- **Evolution Space**: Bootstrap compiler and golden repository integration

**Note**: This represents the target architecture. Current implementation follows traditional layers but is designed for space-based transformation.

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Agent-Everything System**: The `internal/llm/agent/` package is evolving toward an agent-everything architecture where every capability is an intelligent agent that can learn, evolve, and coordinate. Current agents (coder, summarizer, title, task) represent the foundation for expansion to agents handling UI, data, coordination, and evolution itself.

**Tool System**: `internal/llm/tools/` provides extensible tool integration. Tools implement `BaseTool` interface and are automatically available to AI agents. Built-in tools include file operations (view, edit, write), shell execution (bash), code search (grep, glob), and LSP diagnostics.

**Caronex-Orchestrated Architecture**: The `internal/pubsub/` broker provides the foundation for Caronex orchestration, where the central intelligence coordinates agents across spaces. Events flow through Caronex for intelligent routing, coordination decisions, and system evolution triggers.

**Configuration Cascade**: Uses Viper with multiple config sources: global (`~/.ii.json`), project-local (`./.ii.json`), and environment variables. The config system automatically selects default models based on available API keys.

**Session Management**: Implements hierarchical sessions with parent-child relationships, automatic summarization when approaching context limits, and persistent storage of conversation history with cost tracking.

### Meta-System Integration Points

The codebase is structured to support transformation into a self-evolving meta-system:

- **Caronex Integration**: Current services in `internal/app/` provide foundation for Caronex orchestrator
- **Space Framework**: Existing architecture can be refactored into space-based execution environments
- **Agent Evolution**: Current agent system in `internal/llm/agent/` expands to agent-everything architecture
- **Bootstrap Compiler**: Template system in `templates/` becomes foundation for system self-improvement
- **Golden Repository**: Configuration system supports collective intelligence integration

### Database Schema

SQLite with automatic migrations. Key tables:
- `sessions`: Conversation sessions with token/cost tracking
- `messages`: Individual messages with content, tool calls, and attachments  
- `files`: File change tracking for session context

Generated code in `internal/db/` uses SQLC for type-safe database operations.

## Important Files

- `documentation/ContextPrime.md`: Vision document for Intelligence Interface evolution
- `internal/app/app.go`: Main application bootstrap and service coordination
- `internal/tui/tui.go`: TUI state management and event routing
- `internal/llm/agent/agent.go`: Core agent orchestration and streaming
- `internal/config/config.go`: Multi-source configuration management
- `templates/projects/go_backend_gorm/`: Reference template system for hexagonal Go backends

## Configuration

The application uses cascading configuration:
1. Global: `~/.ii.json` 
2. Project: `./.ii.json`
3. Environment variables (API keys, endpoints)

API keys are automatically detected from environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.). The system selects appropriate default models based on available providers.

LSP integration requires language servers to be installed separately (e.g., `gopls` for Go).

## Development Workflow Guidance
