### In Progress üîÑ
1. **Complete System Validation**
   - Verify all existing features still work end-to-end
   - Test remaining failing tests (prompt and tools configuration issues)

2. **Test Coverage Enhancement**
   - Address remaining test configuration issues
   - Continue working toward 100% coverage target

### Pending ‚è≥
1. **CLAUDE.md Updates**
   - Continue capturing critical implementation patterns
   - Document best practices discovered
   - Maintain coding standards in existing CLAUDE.md file

## Phase 2: Refactor Planning

### Pre-work Completed
- Hybrid architecture design documented in systemPatterns.md
- New directory structure planned in DirectoryStructure.md
- Module responsibilities clearly defined

### Ready for Phase 2
- Architecture patterns established
- Clear vision for AI-optimized structure
- MCP integration points identified

## Phase 3: Synthesis Preparation

### Foundation Laid
- Template system already exists in `templates/projects/`
- Understanding of repetitive code patterns
- Config-driven approach planned

### Research Needed
- Analyze existing templates for patterns
- Design template engine architecture
- Plan config schema structure

## Phase 4: Expansion Ideas

### Captured Requirements
- Inbuilt memory system (beyond OpenCode.md)
- Manager agent capabilities
- Task manager integration
- Crew and flow orchestration

## Key Metrics

### Code Metrics
- **Files Analyzed**: 50+
- **Memory Files Created**: 8/8 core files
- **Test Coverage**: TBD (pending measurement)
- **Documentation Pages**: 6 comprehensive docs

### Time Tracking
- **Phase 1 Time Invested**: ~2 hours
- **Estimated Phase 1 Remaining**: ~2-3 hours
- **Phase 2 Estimate**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 3 Estimate**: 1 week

## Risk Register

### Identified Risks
1. **Test Coverage Gaps**: May require significant effort
2. **Refactor Complexity**: Phase 2 will touch every file
3. **Template Engine**: Phase 3 is novel approach

### Mitigation Progress
- Documentation first approach ‚úÖ
- Clear architecture vision ‚úÖ
- Incremental validation planned

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Run `go build` and verify compilation
2. Execute `go run main.go` to test basic functionality
3. Run `go test ./... -cover` to check coverage
4. Update CLAUDE.md with discovered patterns and critical implementation notes
5. Update this progress file with test results

## Discoveries & Insights

### Technical Discoveries
1. **MCP Integration**: Already built-in, perfect for our needs
2. **Provider Abstraction**: Well-designed, supports 9+ providers
3. **Tool System**: Extensible design aligns with our vision
4. **Event System**: Pub/sub pattern enables loose coupling

### Architecture Insights
1. **Separation**: Clean layer separation already exists
2. **Extensibility**: Plugin patterns throughout codebase
3. **Performance**: Efficient design with streaming support
4. **Security**: Permission system for tool execution
