# Coordination Context

## Caronex: The Central Orchestrator

### Meta-System Philosophy
Caronex operates as the central nervous system of the Intelligence Interface, orchestrating all agents, spaces, and evolutionary processes. Unlike traditional systems that have fixed architectures, Caronex represents a **meta-system** that continuously evolves its own structure and capabilities.

### Caronex Responsibilities

#### 1. Agent Orchestra Conductor
- **Agent Lifecycle**: Spawn, configure, and terminate agents based on evolving needs
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute compute, memory, and context across agent spaces
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor agent efficiency and evolve their capabilities
- **Conflict Resolution**: Mediate between competing agent objectives

#### 2. User Space Management
- **Space Evolution**: Continuously refine user workspaces through usage patterns and conversation
- **Space Configuration**: Configure UI layout, tools, and integrations per space (evolving over time)
- **Space Switching**: Hotkey-based switching between persistent user workspaces
- **Space Persistence**: Local state and configuration storage with evolutionary history for each space

#### 3. Configuration Evolution
- **Schema Evolution**: Modify configuration schemas as system capabilities expand
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility while evolving interfaces
- **Hot Reconfiguration**: Apply changes without system restarts
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure consistency across the entire system

#### 4. Golden Repository Integration
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful patterns for golden repository contribution
- **Template Synthesis**: Create reusable templates from proven implementations
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Transform local learning into global knowledge
- **Community Coordination**: Participate in the broader Intelligence Interface ecosystem

#### 5. Technical Debt Management
- **Debt Monitoring**: Track and prioritize technical debt across all system components
- **Quality Coordination**: Ensure agents log tech debt during implementation
- **Debt Resolution Planning**: Coordinate tech debt reduction sprints and activities
- **Code Quality Oversight**: Maintain high code quality standards across the meta-system

## Coordination Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Orchestration
```yaml
Event: UserRequestsSpaceEnhancement
Caronex_Response:
  - Analyze: Enhancement complexity and integration with existing space
  - Plan: Determine which existing space to enhance and required capabilities
  - Enhance: Add new agents/tools to user's existing persistent workspace
  - Configure: Update space configuration to integrate new features
  - Integrate: Merge enhancement into evolving space capability
  - Learn: Update space preferences for continuous evolution
```

## Coordination Protocols

### 1. Agent Communication Protocol
- **Message Routing**: Caronex routes messages between agents across spaces
- **Priority Queuing**: High-priority tasks get immediate attention
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work across available agent instances
- **Failure Handling**: Automatic retry and failover mechanisms

### 2. Space Interaction Protocol
- **Boundary Crossing**: Controlled data exchange between spaces
- **State Synchronization**: Keep related spaces in sync
- **Resource Sharing**: Share expensive resources across spaces
- **Isolation Maintenance**: Ensure security and stability boundaries

### 3. Evolution Coordination Protocol
- **Change Detection**: Monitor for improvement opportunities
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential changes before implementation
- **Rollback Capability**: Safely revert changes if needed
- **Gradual Deployment**: Staged rollout of evolutionary changes

### 4. Implementation Agent Coordination Protocol (Added 2025-06-15)

#### Memory Integration Workflow
- **Complete Memory Reading**: All implementation agents must read ALL memory files before starting work
- **Memory File Priority**: Foundation files → Coordination files → Enforcement files
- **Context Application**: Use memory insights to guide all architectural and implementation decisions
- **Memory Updates**: Update relevant memory files upon task completion

#### BDD-Driven Implementation
- **Scenario-First Development**: Write detailed Gherkin scenarios before implementation
- **Acceptance Criteria Validation**: Use BDD scenarios as non-negotiable quality gates
- **Red-Green-Refactor Compliance**: Follow strict BDD development cycle
- **Evolutionary Testing**: Include And-Evolves clauses for meta-system validation

#### Tech Debt Integration Workflow
- **Pre-Development**: Read `.claude/TechDebt.md` before starting any work
- **During Development**: Log all shortcuts, workarounds, and technical compromises immediately
- **Post-Development**: Update tech debt status and resolution timelines
- **Continuous Assessment**: Re-evaluate tech debt priorities based on system evolution

#### Quality Gate Enforcement
- **Build Validation**: All changes must maintain build integrity
- **Test Preservation**: All existing tests must continue passing
- **Functionality Validation**: Zero tolerance for functionality regression
