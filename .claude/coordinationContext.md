# Coordination Context

## Caronex: The Central Orchestrator

### Meta-System Philosophy
Caronex operates as the central nervous system of the Intelligence Interface, orchestrating all agents, spaces, and evolutionary processes. Unlike traditional systems that have fixed architectures, Caronex represents a **meta-system** that continuously evolves its own structure and capabilities.

### Caronex Responsibilities

#### 1. Agent Orchestra Conductor
- **Agent Lifecycle**: Spawn, configure, and terminate agents based on evolving needs
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute compute, memory, and context across agent spaces
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor agent efficiency and evolve their capabilities
- **Conflict Resolution**: Mediate between competing agent objectives

#### 2. User Space Management
- **Space Evolution**: Continuously refine user workspaces through usage patterns and conversation
- **Space Configuration**: Configure UI layout, tools, and integrations per space (evolving over time)
- **Space Switching**: Hotkey-based switching between persistent user workspaces
- **Space Persistence**: Local state and configuration storage with evolutionary history for each space

#### 3. Configuration Evolution
- **Schema Evolution**: Modify configuration schemas as system capabilities expand
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility while evolving interfaces
- **Hot Reconfiguration**: Apply changes without system restarts
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure consistency across the entire system

#### 4. Golden Repository Integration
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful patterns for golden repository contribution
- **Template Synthesis**: Create reusable templates from proven implementations
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Transform local learning into global knowledge
- **Community Coordination**: Participate in the broader Intelligence Interface ecosystem

#### 5. Technical Debt Management
- **Debt Monitoring**: Track and prioritize technical debt across all system components
- **Quality Coordination**: Ensure agents log tech debt during implementation
- **Debt Resolution Planning**: Coordinate tech debt reduction sprints and activities
- **Code Quality Oversight**: Maintain high code quality standards across the meta-system

## Coordination Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Orchestration
