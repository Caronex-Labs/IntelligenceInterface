# BDD Workflows

## Behavior-Driven Development for Meta-Systems

The Intelligence Interface requires behavior-driven development approaches that can handle self-evolving systems, agent coordination, and meta-system capabilities. Traditional BDD must be extended to support evolutionary and emergent behaviors.

## BDD Philosophy for Intelligence Interface

### Traditional BDD Enhancement
- **Given-When-Then** extends to **Given-When-Then-Evolves**
- **Scenarios** become **Evolutionary Scenarios**
- **Features** become **Emergent Capabilities**
- **User Stories** become **Intelligence Stories**

### Meta-System BDD Principles
1. **Behaviors can evolve** during the test lifecycle
2. **Agents can learn** from BDD scenarios
3. **System architecture** can adapt based on behavior patterns
4. **Expectations** can be refined through system learning

## BDD Categories for Intelligence Interface

### 1. User Behavior Scenarios
**Focus**: How users interact with the evolving system

```gherkin
Feature: Adaptive User Interface
  As a developer
  I want the system to learn my preferences
  So that my workflow becomes more efficient over time

  Scenario: Interface learns user preferences
    Given I am a new user of Intelligence Interface
    When I consistently use TUI mode over CLI mode
    And I prefer dark themes over light themes
    And I frequently use specific AI providers
    Then the system should adapt to prefer TUI mode
    And the system should default to dark themes
    And the system should prioritize my preferred AI providers
    And the system should suggest workflow optimizations

  Scenario: System evolves based on user patterns
    Given the system has learned my preferences
    When I start a new coding session
    Then the system should proactively configure my preferred environment
    And the system should suggest relevant templates
    And the system should pre-load frequently used agents
```

### 2. Agent Behavior Scenarios
**Focus**: How individual agents and agent coordination behave

```gherkin
Feature: Agent Learning and Coordination
  As the system
  I want agents to learn from experience
  So that they become more effective over time

  Scenario: Coder agent learns from successful patterns
    Given a coder agent has generated code multiple times
    When the generated code consistently follows certain patterns
    And the patterns result in successful outcomes
    Then the agent should recognize these patterns
    And the agent should apply similar patterns to new requests
    And the agent should improve code generation quality

  Scenario: Agent coordination for complex tasks
    Given a complex feature request requiring multiple agents
    When the coordinator agent receives the request
    Then it should spawn appropriate specialist agents
    And it should allocate them to dedicated spaces
    And it should coordinate their interactions
    And it should synthesize their outputs
    And it should learn from the coordination success
```

### 3. System Evolution Scenarios
**Focus**: How the system evolves its own capabilities

```gherkin
Feature: Self-Evolution Capability
  As the Intelligence Interface system
  I want to evolve my own capabilities
  So that I become more powerful and useful over time

  Scenario: System identifies improvement opportunities
    Given the system is running normal operations
    When the system detects repetitive inefficiencies
    And the system has access to improvement templates
    Then the system should propose evolution options
    And the system should safely test improvements
    And the system should implement beneficial changes
    And the system should maintain rollback capability

  Scenario: Bootstrap compiler creates system improvements
    Given the system has identified a needed capability
    When the bootstrap compiler is triggered
    Then it should generate appropriate code
    And it should test the code in isolation
    And it should integrate the code safely
    And it should update system documentation
    And it should contribute patterns to golden repository
```

### 4. Configuration Evolution Scenarios
**Focus**: How configuration-driven behavior adapts

```gherkin
Feature: Configuration-Driven Evolution
  As a system administrator
  I want configuration changes to drive system evolution
  So that the system adapts to changing requirements

  Scenario: UI configuration drives interface evolution
    Given the system has a current UI configuration
    When the configuration is updated to add new components
    Then the system should dynamically create new UI elements
    And the system should maintain existing functionality
    And the system should provide migration paths
    And the system should validate configuration consistency

  Scenario: Agent configuration creates new capabilities
    Given the system has standard agent types
    When configuration defines a new agent specialization
    Then the system should create the new agent type
    And the system should provide appropriate tools
    And the system should integrate with existing coordination
    And the system should track new agent performance
```

## BDD Implementation Patterns

### 1. Evolutionary Scenario Pattern
```gherkin
Feature: [Capability Name]
  As [stakeholder]
  I want [capability]
  So that [benefit]
  And the system evolves to [improvement]

  Background:
    Given the system is in [initial state]
    And the system has [baseline capabilities]

  Scenario: [Behavior] evolves over time
    Given [initial conditions]
    When [trigger event] occurs
    Then [immediate behavior] should happen
    And over time [evolutionary behavior] should emerge
    And the system should [maintain stability]
    And the system should [improve metrics]
```

### 2. Agent Interaction Pattern
```gherkin
Scenario: Multi-agent coordination
  Given agents [agent1, agent2, agent3] are available
  And they have [specific capabilities]
  When [complex task] is requested
  Then Caronex should coordinate the agents
  And each agent should work in [appropriate space]
  And agents should [communicate effectively]
  And the result should [meet requirements]
  And coordination patterns should [be learned]
```

### 3. Meta-System Pattern
```gherkin
Scenario: System self-modification
  Given the system has [current architecture]
  And the system detects [improvement opportunity]
  When [evolution trigger] occurs
  Then the system should [safely modify itself]
  And the system should [validate changes]
  And the system should [maintain compatibility]
  And the system should [be able to rollback]
```

## BDD Test Implementation

    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        s.system.LaunchTUI(s.user)
        s.system.RecordPreference(s.user, "interface", "tui")
    }
}

func (s *BDDSuite) ThenTheSystemShouldAdaptToPreferTUIMode() {
    preferences := s.system.GetLearnedPreferences(s.user)
    assert.Equal(s.T(), "tui", preferences.DefaultInterface)
}

// Meta-system BDD steps
func (s *BDDSuite) GivenTheSystemDetectsImprovementOpportunity() {
    s.system.InjectImprovementScenario(s.improvementScenario)
    s.initialCapabilities = s.system.GetCapabilities()
}

func (s *BDDSuite) WhenBootstrapCompilerIsTriggered() {
    s.evolution = s.system.TriggerEvolution(s.improvementScenario)
}

func (s *BDDSuite) ThenItShouldSafelyModifyItself() {
    assert.True(s.T(), s.evolution.IsSuccessful())
    assert.True(s.T(), s.evolution.IsReversible())
    assert.True(s.T(), s.system.IsStable())
    newCapabilities := s.system.GetCapabilities()
    assert.True(s.T(), newCapabilities.IsSuperset(s.initialCapabilities))
}
```

### 2. Agent Behavior Testing

```go
func (s *BDDSuite) GivenCoderAgentHasGeneratedCodeMultipleTimes() {
    s.agent = s.system.GetAgent(AgentTypeCoder)
    for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
        result := s.agent.GenerateCode(s.testScenarios[i])
        s.agent.RecordOutcome(result, s.testOutcomes[i])
    }
}

func (s *BDDSuite) WhenTheGeneratedCodeFollowsPatterns() {
    patterns := s.agent.RecognizePatterns()
    assert.True(s.T(), len(patterns) > 0)
    s.recognizedPatterns = patterns
}

func (s *BDDSuite) ThenTheAgentShouldApplySimilarPatterns() {
    newRequest := CreateTestRequest()
    result := s.agent.GenerateCode(newRequest)
    
    patternUsed := s.agent.GetPatternUsage(result)
    assert.Contains(s.T(), s.recognizedPatterns, patternUsed)
}
```

### 3. System Evolution Testing

```go
func (s *BDDSuite) GivenTheSystemHasCurrentArchitecture() {
    s.initialArchitecture = s.system.GetArchitecture()
    s.initialPerformance = s.system.BenchmarkPerformance()
}

func (s *BDDSuite) WhenEvolutionTriggerOccurs() {
    trigger := EvolutionTrigger{
        Type:     "performance_optimization",
        Target:   "agent_coordination",
        Expected: "20%_improvement",
    }
    s.evolution = s.system.TriggerEvolution(trigger)
}

func (s *BDDSuite) ThenTheSystemShouldImproveMetrics() {
    newPerformance := s.system.BenchmarkPerformance()
    improvement := newPerformance.CompareTo(s.initialPerformance)
    assert.True(s.T(), improvement.IsImprovement())
    assert.True(s.T(), improvement.MeetsExpectation("20%_improvement"))
}
```

## BDD Scenarios for Core Features

### 1. Template System Evolution
```gherkin
Feature: Template System Self-Improvement
  As the system
  I want to improve my templates based on usage
  So that code generation becomes more effective

  Scenario: Template learns from successful generations
    Given a template has been used 100 times
    When 90% of generations are successful
    And common patterns are identified in successful generations
    Then the template should incorporate successful patterns
    And the template should deprecate less successful patterns
    And the template should improve its success rate

  Scenario: Template creates specialized variants
    Given a general template is used for diverse scenarios
    When usage patterns show distinct categories
    Then the system should create specialized template variants
    And each variant should be optimized for its use case
    And the system should route requests to appropriate variants
```

### 2. Space-Based Architecture
```gherkin
Feature: Dynamic Space Management
  As the system
  I want to create and manage spaces dynamically
  So that I can optimize resource usage and isolation

  Scenario: System creates new spaces for workload isolation
    Given the system is handling multiple concurrent requests
    When workloads have conflicting resource requirements
    Then the system should create isolated spaces
    And each space should have appropriate resource allocation
    And spaces should not interfere with each other
    And the system should monitor space efficiency

  Scenario: Spaces evolve based on usage patterns
    Given a space has been running for extended time
    When usage patterns stabilize
    Then the space should optimize its configuration
    And the space should tune its resource allocation
    And the space should improve its performance metrics
```

### 3. Golden Repository Integration
```gherkin
Feature: Golden Repository Contribution
  As the system
  I want to contribute successful patterns to the golden repository
  So that the entire ecosystem benefits from my learning

  Scenario: System identifies contribution-worthy patterns
    Given the system has developed successful patterns
    When patterns meet quality and reusability criteria
    Then the system should package patterns for contribution
    And the system should validate patterns across scenarios
    And the system should submit patterns to golden repository
    And the system should track contribution acceptance

  Scenario: System integrates improvements from golden repository
    Given the golden repository has new pattern updates
    When updates are relevant to system capabilities
    Then the system should evaluate update benefits
    And the system should safely integrate improvements
    And the system should validate integration success
```
