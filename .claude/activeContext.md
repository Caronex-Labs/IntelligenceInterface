### Technical Decisions

#### Architecture Understanding
- **Current State**: Traditional multi-layer architecture suitable for refactoring
- **Target State**: Space-based meta-system with:
  - Caronex central orchestrator
  - Dynamic agent spaces (UI, management, data, evolution)
  - Agent-everything architecture
  - Bootstrap compiler for self-improvement
  - Golden repository integration

#### Key Discoveries
1. **Memory Evolution**: Enhanced from simple Intelligence Interface.md to comprehensive meta-system documentation
2. **Template Foundation**: Existing templates provide bootstrap compiler foundation
3. **Agent Foundation**: Current agent system (coder, summarizer, title, task) can evolve into agent-everything
4. **Event System**: Pub/sub pattern can be enhanced for Caronex orchestration
5. **MCP Protocol**: Perfect foundation for space-based communication

### Blockers & Considerations

#### Current Blockers
- None at this moment

#### Considerations
1. **Testing Strategy**: Need to understand the existing test patterns before adding new tests
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Must ensure any changes maintain Intelligence Interface feature parity
3. **Memory Evolution**: Consider how to evolve from Intelligence Interface.md to more sophisticated memory system

### Environment Setup

#### Verified Prerequisites
- Go 1.24.0 environment
- Project cloned to: `/Users/caronex/Work/CaronexLabs/IntelligenceInterface`
- Memory bank initialized at `.claude/`

#### Pending Setup
- Install SQLC: `go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest`
- Install Goose: `go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest`
- Set up API keys for testing different providers

### Architecture Notes

#### Current Intelligence Interface Architecture
- **Strengths**: Clean separation, extensible tool system, multi-provider support
- **Opportunities**: Can be optimized for AI-first workflows, template integration

#### Planned Intelligence Interface Architecture
- **Space-Based Meta-System**: Dynamic, configurable execution environments
- **Caronex Orchestration**: Central intelligence coordinating all system aspects
- **Agent-Everything**: Every capability as an intelligent, evolving agent
- **Bootstrap Compiler**: Self-improving system generating its own enhancements
- **Golden Repository Integration**: Collective intelligence and pattern sharing

### Risk Management

#### Identified Risks
1. **Complexity**: The refactor in Phase 2 will be substantial
2. **Testing**: Achieving 100% test coverage may reveal architectural issues
3. **Breaking Changes**: Must carefully track any Intelligence Interface compatibility issues

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental testing improvements
- Detailed documentation of all changes
- Feature flag system for new functionality

### Communication & Coordination

#### Documentation Standards
- All memory files use Markdown format
- Technical decisions documented in activeContext.md
- Progress tracked in progress.md
- Patterns captured in CLAUDE.md (project root)

#### Review Cycles
- After each major task completion
- Before moving to next phase
- When discovering new patterns or issues

### Next Session Priorities

1. **Immediate**: Update CLAUDE.md with self-evolving system guidance
2. **Short-term**: Validate current system functionality before transformation
3. **Medium-term**: Begin space-based architecture design
4. **Long-term**: Implement Caronex orchestrator as central nervous system

### Notes for Future Sessions
- **Meta-System Focus**: Every decision should support self-evolving architecture
- **Caronex First**: All components should be designed for Caronex orchestration
- **Space-Based Thinking**: Replace layer thinking with space-based architecture
- **Agent-Everything**: Convert all capabilities to intelligent agents
- **Bootstrap Compiler**: Prepare for system self-improvement capabilities
- **Golden Repository**: Plan for collective intelligence integration
