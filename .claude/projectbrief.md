# Intelligence Interface Project Brief

## Mission Statement

Create a self-evolving meta-system that serves as an intelligent orchestrator of AI capabilities, where Caronex acts as the central nervous system coordinating agents, spaces, and evolutionary processes. Starting as a developer tool, it will bootstrap itself into a universal platform for intelligence amplification and system evolution.

## Meta-System Philosophy

The Intelligence Interface is not just software - it's a **bootstrap compiler for intelligence systems**. It can modify, improve, and evolve itself through:
- **Self-evolving architecture** that adapts based on usage patterns
- **Caronex orchestration** managing all system components and evolution
- **Space-based computing** providing flexible, configurable environments
- **Agent-everything approach** where every capability is an agent
- **Golden repository integration** contributing to and learning from collective intelligence

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Low Cost, High Efficiency**: Minimize token usage while maximizing workflow productivity
2. **Infinite Customizability**: Provide a flexible platform for building personal AI systems
3. **Developer Excellence**: Initially focus on being an exceptional developer tool
4. **Future Expansion**: Design for extensibility to support diverse use cases beyond development
5. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality through comprehensive tech debt tracking and resolution

### Vision
Transform computing itself by creating a meta-system that bootstraps intelligence evolution, moving from:
- Current: `Developer → AI → Code → Software Systems`
- Intelligence Interface: `Human Intent → Caronex → Agent Orchestra → Space-Based Execution → Self-Evolving Systems`

This creates a **bootstrap compiler** effect where the system continuously improves its own capabilities, learns from patterns, and contributes to a golden repository of collective intelligence.

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Maintain compatibility with 9+ AI providers and 40+ models
2. **Tool Extensibility**: Easy integration of new tools following standard interfaces
3. **Session Management**: Hierarchical sessions with auto-summarization and context management
4. **Cost Tracking**: Monitor token usage and costs across all providers
5. **Template System**: Configuration-driven code generation through synthesis

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Fast TUI response times with efficient context management
2. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and session persistence
3. **Usability**: Intuitive interface for both CLI and TUI modes
4. **Extensibility**: Modular architecture supporting easy feature additions
5. **Security**: Safe tool execution with permission management

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (Setup) - Current
- ✅ Successfully fork and understand OpenCode architecture
- ✅ Document features, logic, and directory structure
- ⏳ Achieve 100% test coverage
- ⏳ Validate system functionality

### Phase 2 (Refactor)
- Design space-based architecture with Caronex orchestration
- Implement configuration-driven system evolution
- Create agent-everything architecture patterns
- Transform from static application to self-evolving meta-system

### Phase 3 (Synthesis)
- Implement bootstrap compiler for self-improvement
- Create template engine that evolves and improves itself
- Enable system to generate its own improvements
- Integrate with golden repository for collective learning

### Phase 4 (Expansion)
- Achieve true self-evolving system status
- Enable system to spawn and manage new Intelligence Interface instances
- Create ecosystem of interconnected meta-systems
- Establish collective intelligence network with golden repository

## Target Users

### Primary
- **Software Developers**: Need efficient AI-powered coding assistance
- **AI Power Users**: Want customizable AI workflows
- **Development Teams**: Seek standardized AI integration

### Secondary (Future)
- **Content Creators**: AI-assisted content generation
- **Researchers**: Custom AI analysis workflows
- **Business Users**: Automated workflow creation

## Technical Foundation

Built on OpenCode's proven architecture:
- **Language**: Go with Bubble Tea TUI framework
- **Database**: SQLite with automatic migrations
- **Protocols**: LSP and MCP for tool integration
- **Configuration**: Multi-source cascade (global, project, environment)

## Differentiation

### Unique Value Propositions
1. **Meta-System Architecture**: Self-evolving system that improves its own capabilities
2. **Caronex Orchestration**: Central intelligence that coordinates all system aspects
3. **Space-Based Computing**: Flexible, configurable execution environments
4. **Bootstrap Compiler**: System that can generate improvements to itself
5. **Golden Repository Integration**: Collective intelligence and pattern sharing
6. **Agent-Everything**: Every capability is an intelligent agent that can evolve

### Competitive Advantages
- Forked from proven OpenCode foundation
- Designed specifically for AI-first workflows
- Template system eliminates repetitive AI coding
- Future-proof architecture for emerging AI capabilities

## Constraints & Considerations

1. **Token Optimization**: Must minimize AI token usage without sacrificing quality
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain OpenCode feature parity during refactor
3. **Learning Curve**: Balance power with usability for different user types
4. **Resource Usage**: Keep system lightweight and responsive

## Project Philosophy

Intelligence Interface represents a paradigm shift toward **meta-system intelligence**, where:
- **Systems evolve themselves** rather than being programmed
- **Caronex orchestrates** all aspects of system behavior and evolution
- **Spaces provide** flexible, configurable computing environments
- **Agents handle** every capability from UI to data management
- **Configuration drives** not just behavior but system architecture itself
- **Bootstrap compilation** enables continuous self-improvement
- **Golden repository** creates collective intelligence ecosystem

The ultimate goal is to create the first true **self-evolving software system** that can improve its own architecture, capabilities, and intelligence over time while contributing to and learning from a global network of similar systems.
