```

## Configuration

### API Keys Setup

For AI features to work, set up API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or set before running
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-key"
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-key"
```

The system automatically selects appropriate models based on available API keys.

go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

## Development

### Building for Production
```bash
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o ii
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Generate database code from SQL (requires sqlc)
sqlc generate

# Database migrations are automatically applied on startup
# Migration files are in: internal/db/migrations/
```

### Code Generation

# Go template generation (future feature)
go run templates/projects/go_backend_gorm/cmd/standardize/main.go --config user_domain.yaml
```

## Architecture

### Space-Based Meta-System Architecture
- **Caronex Core**: Central orchestrator coordinating all system components
- **User Interface Space**: TUI/CLI/API agents providing adaptive user interaction
- **Agent Management Space**: Dynamic agent spawning, coordination, and evolution
- **Data Management Space**: Session, memory, and cache agents with persistence
- **Evolution Space**: Bootstrap compiler and golden repository integration

### Key Components

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Ensure Go 1.24+ is installed: `go version`
- Run `go mod tidy` to clean up dependencies

### Missing Configuration
- The application creates configuration files automatically
- Check `~/.ii.json` for global settings

### API Errors
- Verify API keys are set correctly in environment
- Check provider-specific error messages in debug mode

### Database Issues
- SQLite database is created automatically at first run
- Database location: `./ii.db` (configurable)

### Performance Issues
- Use debug mode (`-d`) to identify bottlenecks
- Check token usage in session management
- Monitor provider response times

## The Vision

Intelligence Interface isn't just another productivity tool - it's an AI-powered desktop environment that evolves with you. Think of Spaces like different desktops on your Mac - each one evolved over time for the work you regularly do:

- **Knowledge Base Space**: Like your personal library that has grown to understand exactly how you research and write
- **Development Space**: Like your workshop that has accumulated all the tools and configurations you've perfected over years of coding
- **Social Space**: Like your office setup that knows your team, your communication patterns, and your collaboration preferences

You switch between spaces with simple hotkeys, and each space remembers everything about how you like to work.
