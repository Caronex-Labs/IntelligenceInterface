## Scope Management

### **Scope Creep Tracking**

This section tracks additions, modifications, and scope changes discovered during sprint execution to maintain transparency and inform future sprint planning.

#### **Added Tasks (Scope Additions)**
- **[Task X.X]: [Task Name]** 
  - **Reason**: [Why this task was discovered/needed]
  - **Impact**: [Effect on timeline, dependencies, resources]
  - **Justification**: [Business/technical justification for inclusion]
  - **Effort**: [Estimated effort level: Low/Medium/High]
  - **Status**: [Current status]

#### **Modified Tasks (Scope Changes)**
- **[Task X]: [Task Name]**
  - **Change**: [What was modified from original scope]
  - **Reason**: [Why the change was necessary]
  - **Impact**: [Effect on timeline, dependencies, other tasks]
  - **Justification**: [Why the change was approved]

#### **Removed Tasks (Scope Reductions)**
- **[Task X]: [Task Name]**
  - **Reason**: [Why task was removed or deferred]
  - **Impact**: [Effect on sprint goals and dependencies]
  - **Deferral Plan**: [When/how task will be addressed]

#### **Scope Impact Analysis**
- **Total Tasks**: [Original count] → [Final count] tasks ([X]% scope change)
- **Phase Impact**: [Analysis of which phases were most affected]
- **Timeline Impact**: [Effect on sprint duration and milestones]
- **Quality Impact**: [Positive/negative effects on deliverable quality]
- **Risk Impact**: [How scope changes affected project risks]

### **Scope Control Measures**
- **Discovery Protocol**: Log scope changes immediately in implementation logs
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate effort, timeline, and dependency impacts
- **Approval Process**: Document justification for all scope additions
- **Sprint Goal Protection**: Ensure scope changes don't compromise sprint objectives

## Sprint Execution Strategy

### **Phase Execution Order**

1. **Phase 1**: [Execution approach and dependencies]
2. **Phase 2**: [Execution approach and dependencies]
3. **Phase N**: [Final phase execution]

### **Quality Gates for All Tasks**

- ✅ All memory files read and understood by implementation agents
- ✅ MCP documentation queried for non-trivial implementations
- ✅ BDD Gherkin scenarios written first
- ✅ Playwright tests implemented and passing
- ✅ All existing tests still passing
- ✅ Code follows .clinerules patterns
- ✅ Git commit with descriptive message
- ✅ Implementation feedback provided in implementationLogs.md
- ✅ Quality insights documented in qualityFeedback.md

### **Coordination Protocol**

- **Memory Bank Integration**: All agents must read complete memory context
- **Feedback Loop**: Mandatory feedback in implementationLogs.md and qualityFeedback.md
- **Task Evaluation**: 6-step completion verification process
- **Follow-up Tasks**: .5 tasks for substantial leftovers (reliability, documentation)
