## Quality Assurance with Memory-Dart Integration

### BDD Integration Framework

**Memory-Driven BDD Scenario Creation**:

```gherkin
Feature: Memory-Dart Quality Integration
  As a development team
  I want comprehensive quality assurance across memory and Dart systems
  So that implementation follows intelligence guidance and achieves project objectives

Scenario: Memory Intelligence Quality Gates
  Given memory intelligence provides comprehensive technical context
  When implementation work begins following Dart specifications
  Then memory patterns guide implementation decisions
  And quality standards from memory intelligence are enforced
  And learning feedback enhances memory intelligence quality

Scenario: Dart Project Quality Tracking
  Given Dart project tracks implementation progress and deliverables
  When memory intelligence guides technical decisions and patterns
  Then Dart documentation reflects implementation reality
  And progress tracking aligns with memory intelligence expectations
  And quality gates prevent completion without memory pattern compliance
```
