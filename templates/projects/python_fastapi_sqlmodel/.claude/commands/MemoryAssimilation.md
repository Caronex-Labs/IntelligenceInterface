# Memory Assimilation Protocol

**Sub-command for Memory Coordinator Mode**: Comprehensive memory system update after major sprint completion.

## Purpose

After completing significant development phases (sprints, major features), perform comprehensive memory assimilation to:
- Extract and preserve all insights from implementation logs
- Update architectural patterns based on discovered solutions
- Consolidate lessons learned across all memory files
- Prepare memory system for next development phase

## When to Use

Execute Memory Assimilation after:
- ✅ **Sprint completion** - All planned tasks in sprint completed
- ✅ **Major feature delivery** - Significant architectural or functional changes
- ✅ **Multiple agent coordination** - Parallel agents have completed work
- ✅ **Pattern discovery** - New implementation patterns have emerged

## Memory Assimilation Process

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Analysis

#### 1. Task Completion Review
**Validate completed tasks against sprint planning:**
- Cross-reference `.claude/activeContext.md` and sprint documentation
- Verify all BDD scenarios were addressed and acceptance criteria met
- Confirm all quality gates passed (tests, builds, functionality)
- Document any incomplete or partially completed work

#### 2. Tech Debt Reconciliation
**Analyze `.claude/TechDebt.md` against implementation:**
- Review tech debt items created during implementation period
- Validate resolution of tech debt items marked as resolved
- Update status of in-progress tech debt items
- Re-evaluate priorities based on current system state
- Extract new tech debt patterns discovered

#### 3. Implementation Log Analysis
```bash
# Read and analyze all recent implementation logs
.claude/implementationLogs.md
```
**Extract:**

#### 14. Sprint Documentation Updates
**Update sprint planning documents with current status:**
- Update task completion status (PENDING → COMPLETED)
- Add quality metrics and BDD compliance results
- Update completion percentages and phase progress
- Document technical achievements and patterns discovered
- Add new tasks discovered during implementation (scope additions)
- Update dependencies between tasks based on implementation learnings

#### 15. Command Enhancement
**Update agent command files based on insights:**
- `.claude/commands/Quickfire.md` - Enhanced patterns
- `.claude/commands/BDDImplementation.md` - Improved workflows
- Tech debt management workflow improvements
- Other commands as needed

### Phase 4: Knowledge Validation & Documentation

#### 16. Task Completion Validation
**Verify task completion accuracy:**
- Confirm all claimed completed tasks actually meet acceptance criteria
- Validate BDD scenario fulfillment against implementation logs
- Ensure all quality gates were properly met
- Document any tasks requiring follow-up work

#### 17. Tech Debt Validation
**Verify tech debt accuracy:**
- Confirm all resolved tech debt items are actually resolved
- Validate new tech debt items are properly documented
- Ensure priority assessments reflect current system reality
- Check tech debt resolution timeline feasibility

#### 18. Pattern Validation
**Verify all updated patterns:**
- Check for consistency across memory files
- Validate new patterns against project requirements
- Ensure coordination protocols are clear
- Confirm tech debt patterns are actionable

#### 19. Implementation Log Completion
**Add assimilation entry to implementationLogs.md:**
```markdown
