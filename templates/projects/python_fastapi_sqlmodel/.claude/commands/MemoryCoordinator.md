```gherkin
Feature: Intelligence-Driven Agent Coordination
  As a Memory Intelligence Coordinator
  I want to provide comprehensive intelligence context to agents
  So that implementation follows learned patterns and enhances memory

Scenario: Intelligence Context Provision
  Given I have synthesized complete memory intelligence
  When an agent requests implementation guidance
  Then I provide comprehensive technical and architectural context
  And I include learning patterns from memory analysis
  And I specify feedback requirements for memory enhancement

Scenario: Learning Integration from Implementation
  Given an agent has completed implementation work
  When I receive implementation feedback and insights
  Then I integrate learning into memory intelligence
  And I update architecture patterns with discoveries
  And I enhance coordination patterns for future work
```
