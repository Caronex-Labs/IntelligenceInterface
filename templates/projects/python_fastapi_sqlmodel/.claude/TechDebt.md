# Technical Debt Registry

## Technical Debt Management Philosophy

### Proactive Debt Tracking
- **Log Immediately**: All shortcuts, compromises, and quick fixes documented when made
- **Context Preservation**: Full context of why debt was incurred and impact assessment
- **Resolution Planning**: Clear plan for addressing debt with timeline and effort estimates
- **Quality Balance**: Balanced approach between delivery speed and long-term maintainability

### Debt Classification

#### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Blocks development, security risks, or production issues
- **High**: Significant impact on development velocity or code quality
- **Medium**: Moderate impact, should be addressed in planned refactoring
- **Low**: Minor issues, can be addressed during regular maintenance

#### Debt Categories
- **Design Debt**: Architecture or design decisions that need improvement
- **Code Debt**: Implementation shortcuts or code quality issues
- **Test Debt**: Missing or inadequate testing coverage
- **Documentation Debt**: Missing or outdated documentation
- **Infrastructure Debt**: Development or deployment infrastructure issues

## Technical Debt Guidelines

### When to Log Technical Debt

#### Always Log
- **Architecture Shortcuts**: Temporary violations of hexagonal architecture
- **Code Quality Compromises**: Complex code without proper refactoring
- **Missing Tests**: Features implemented without adequate test coverage
- **Configuration Shortcuts**: Hard-coded values or temporary configurations
- **Documentation Gaps**: Features without proper documentation

#### Decision Framework
```
Is this a temporary solution? → YES → Log as technical debt
Will this impact future development? → YES → Log as technical debt
Would you be comfortable explaining this in a code review? → NO → Log as technical debt
Is this the "right" way to implement this? → NO → Log as technical debt
```

### Technical Debt Entry Template
```markdown
## TD-[NUMBER]: [Brief Description]

**Date Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Priority**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Category**: [Design/Code/Test/Documentation/Infrastructure]
**Estimated Effort**: [Hours/Days/Weeks]
**Created By**: [Agent/Developer name]

### Context
[Why was this debt incurred? What was the situation?]

### Current Implementation
[What was actually implemented as the shortcut?]

### Desired Implementation
[What should be implemented properly?]

### Impact Assessment
[How does this affect development, performance, maintainability?]

### Resolution Plan
[Specific steps to resolve this debt]

### Acceptance Criteria
[How will we know this debt is properly resolved?]

### Dependencies
[What other work needs to be done first?]

### Status Updates
[Track progress on resolution]
```

### Resolution Process

#### Planning Phase
1. **Impact Assessment**: Determine current and future impact
2. **Effort Estimation**: Realistic effort estimate for proper resolution
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify prerequisites and blockers
4. **Priority Assignment**: Based on impact and effort analysis

#### Resolution Phase
1. **Implementation Planning**: Detailed approach for resolution
2. **Testing Strategy**: How to validate resolution doesn't break functionality
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Pattern Documentation**: Extract learnings for future prevention

#### Validation Phase
1. **Acceptance Criteria Check**: Verify all criteria met
2. **Regression Testing**: Ensure no new issues introduced
3. **Pattern Validation**: Confirm resolution follows established patterns
4. **Documentation Verification**: Ensure complete and accurate documentation

## Debt Prevention Strategies

### Design Review Process
- **Architecture Review**: All major design decisions reviewed before implementation
- **Pattern Compliance**: Verify implementation follows established patterns
- **Performance Consideration**: Assess performance implications of design decisions
- **Future Impact**: Consider long-term maintainability and extensibility

### Code Quality Gates
- **Type Checking**: All code passes mypy type checking
- **Linting**: All code passes ruff linting
- **Testing**: Adequate test coverage for new functionality
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented

### Template System Specific Considerations

#### Code Generation Debt
- **Template Quality**: Generated code should follow same standards as hand-written code
- **Placeholder Handling**: All placeholder variations properly handled
- **Code Preservation**: Custom code preservation system works reliably
- **Configuration Validation**: YAML configurations properly validated

#### Pattern Consistency Debt
- **Architecture Compliance**: Generated code follows hexagonal architecture
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming across all generated components
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI patterns in generated code
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns

## Quality Monitoring

- **Documentation**: Automated documentation generation and validation

### Manual Reviews
- **Architecture Reviews**: Regular architecture pattern compliance
- **Code Reviews**: Focus on technical debt identification
- **Template Reviews**: Review template quality and patterns
- **Process Reviews**: Evaluate debt management process effectiveness

### Metrics Tracking
- **Debt Creation Rate**: Track new debt items over time
- **Resolution Rate**: Track debt resolution velocity
- **Debt Age**: Monitor how long debt items remain unresolved
- **Impact Assessment**: Track actual vs. predicted impact of debt items

## Integration with Development Process

### Sprint Planning
- **Debt Allocation**: Reserve capacity for debt resolution
