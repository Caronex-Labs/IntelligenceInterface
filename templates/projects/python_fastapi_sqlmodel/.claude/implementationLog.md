### Technical Implementation Notes

#### Dart MCP Integration Patterns

- **API Structure**: Used proper Dart task creation with title, description, status, priority, size
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Established proper parentId references for domain hierarchy
- **Dartboard Management**: Used "Python Backend Template/Backlog" for all tasks
- **Tag Management**: Applied relevant tags for filtering and organization
- **Due Date Format**: Used ISO 8601 format with 9:00 AM UTC timezone

#### Error Resolution Patterns
