# Current BDD Intelligence Level: Advanced
Feature: BDD Pattern Intelligence
  As a Memory Intelligence System
  I want to generate comprehensive BDD scenarios
  So that all implementation follows test-driven development patterns

Background:
  Given memory intelligence has learned effective BDD patterns
  And scenario generation follows business value prioritization
  And technical acceptance criteria align with hexagonal architecture

Scenario: Context-Aware Scenario Generation
  Given a technical requirement with domain complexity
  When I generate BDD scenarios for the requirement
  Then scenarios cover happy path, error handling, and edge cases
  And scenarios align with hexagonal architecture layer separation
  And scenarios include performance and integration considerations

Scenario: Learning from BDD Implementation
  Given BDD scenarios have been implemented and tested
  When I analyze implementation effectiveness and test results
  Then I extract patterns for improved scenario generation
  And I identify testing strategies that enhance development velocity
  And I evolve BDD intelligence for future scenario creation

### Template Variable Resolution Quality Patterns (Discovered 2025-06-26)

#### Template Variable Debugging Excellence
1. **Systematic Template Issue Resolution**: Complete methodology for template rendering problems
   - **Problem Identification**: Template fails with variable access errors (e.g., `{{domain}}` when `domain` is dict)
   - **Debug Script Creation**: Quick validation scripts to understand actual template output
   - **Variable Mapping Analysis**: Understanding configuration structure vs template expectations
   - **Bulk Replacement Strategy**: sed-based systematic replacement across template files

2. **Configuration-Template Alignment**: Ensuring template variables match configuration structure
   - **Pattern**: Use `{{domain.name}}` instead of `{{domain}}` when domain is configuration dict
   - **Tools**: `sed -i '' 's/{{domain}}/{{domain.name}}/g'` for bulk replacement
   - **Validation**: Debug scripts to verify template output before and after fixes
   - **Quality Gate**: All tests must pass before claiming completion

3. **Test Assertion Accuracy**: Ensuring test expectations match actual template output
   - **Text Case Sensitivity**: Template uses `{{domain.name|title}}` producing "User" not "user"
   - **String Matching**: Test assertions must match exact template output
   - **Systematic Validation**: Debug scripts to capture exact generated text
   - **Result**: 100% test success rate through accurate assertion alignment

4. **Memory Update Integration**: Documenting template fixes for future learning
   - **Pattern Documentation**: Template variable resolution patterns added to intelligence patterns
   - **Learning Integration**: Fixes integrated into memory system for future template development
   - **Quality Standards**: 100% test success as non-negotiable completion criteria
   - **Memory Enhancement**: Template debugging patterns available for future reference
