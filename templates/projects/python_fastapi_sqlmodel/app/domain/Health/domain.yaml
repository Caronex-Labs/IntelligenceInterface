# Domain-level Configuration - Co-located YAML
# 
# Co-location Architecture Pattern:
# - This domain.yaml file provides base entity configuration for hierarchical merging
# - Co-located with entities.yaml, templates (.j2), and generated files (.py)
# - Processed by ConfigurationMerger for hierarchical inheritance to entity level

# Domain Metadata
domain:
  name: "Health"
  description: "Health monitoring domain for readiness, liveness and health check endpoints"
  package: "app.domain.Health"
  version: "1.0.0"

# Base Entity Configuration
entity:
  base_class: "BaseEntity"
  abstract_base: true
  
  # Entity mixins for common functionality
  mixins:
    - name: "UUIDMixin"
      description: "UUID primary key generation"
      enabled: true
      import_path: "app.domain.mixins.uuid_mixin"

    - name: "TimestampMixin"
      description: "Created/updated timestamp fields"
      enabled: true
      import_path: "app.domain.mixins.timestamp_mixin"
      fields:
        - "created_at"
        - "updated_at"

# Database Configuration
database:
  table_naming:
    convention: "snake_case"
    prefix: "health_"
    pluralize: true

# Code Generation Configuration  
generation:
  templates:
    preserve_custom_code: true
    preservation_markers: "@pyhex"
    auto_format: true
