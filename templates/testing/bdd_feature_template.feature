Feature: FEATURE_NAME
  As a USER_TYPE
  I want CAPABILITY
  So that BENEFIT

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface system is operational
    And the required dependencies are available

  Scenario: PRIMARY_SUCCESS_SCENARIO
    Given INITIAL_CONDITION
    When USER_ACTION occurs
    Then EXPECTED_OUTCOME should happen
    And ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION should be confirmed

  Scenario: ERROR_HANDLING_SCENARIO
    Given INITIAL_CONDITION_FOR_ERROR
    When INVALID_ACTION occurs
    Then ERROR_SHOULD_BE_HANDLED gracefully
    And SYSTEM_SHOULD_REMAIN_STABLE

  Scenario: EDGE_CASE_SCENARIO
    Given EDGE_CASE_CONDITION
    When BOUNDARY_ACTION is performed
    Then EDGE_CASE_OUTCOME should be achieved
    And SYSTEM_SHOULD_HANDLE_EDGE_CASE properly

  # Meta-System Evolution Scenarios (for future capabilities)
  
  Scenario: SYSTEM_LEARNING_SCENARIO
    Given the system has processed PATTERN multiple times
    When PATTERN_RECOGNITION occurs
    Then the system should LEARN_FROM_PATTERN
    And future SIMILAR_SCENARIOS should be IMPROVED

  Scenario: AGENT_COORDINATION_SCENARIO
    Given multiple agents are available for TASK_TYPE
    When COMPLEX_TASK is requested
    Then AGENT_COORDINATION should occur
    And COLLABORATIVE_RESULT should be achieved
    And COORDINATION_PATTERNS should be learned

  Scenario: SPACE_ISOLATION_SCENARIO
    Given multiple spaces are configured
    When OPERATIONS occur in different spaces
    Then SPACE_BOUNDARIES should be maintained
    And INTER_SPACE_COMMUNICATION should work correctly
    And RESOURCE_ISOLATION should be enforced

  Scenario: CONFIGURATION_EVOLUTION_SCENARIO
    Given current system configuration
    When CONFIGURATION_CHANGE is applied
    Then system should ADAPT_TO_CHANGE
    And BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY should be maintained
    And CONFIGURATION_VALIDATION should pass

  # Template Instructions:
  # 
  # 1. Replace ALL_CAPS placeholders with your specific content:
  #    - FEATURE_NAME: Name of the feature being tested
  #    - USER_TYPE: Type of user (developer, system admin, end user, etc.)
  #    - CAPABILITY: What the user wants to accomplish
  #    - BENEFIT: Why this capability is valuable
  #
  # 2. For each scenario, replace:
  #    - SCENARIO_NAME: Descriptive name for the test scenario
  #    - CONDITIONS: Given statements describing initial state
  #    - ACTIONS: When statements describing what happens
  #    - OUTCOMES: Then statements describing expected results
  #
  # 3. Add more scenarios as needed for comprehensive coverage:
  #    - Happy path scenarios
  #    - Error handling scenarios
  #    - Edge case scenarios
  #    - Performance scenarios (if applicable)
  #    - Security scenarios (if applicable)
  #
  # 4. For meta-system scenarios, consider:
  #    - Agent behavior and learning
  #    - Space-based computing features
  #    - System evolution capabilities
  #    - Configuration-driven behavior
  #
  # 5. Use consistent language and terms:
  #    - Be specific about actions and outcomes
  #    - Use domain terminology appropriately
  #    - Keep scenarios focused and atomic
  #
  # 6. Consider data scenarios:
  #    - Use Scenario Outline for data-driven tests
  #    - Create Examples tables for multiple inputs
  #    - Test boundary values and edge cases
  #
  # Example Scenario Outline:
  #
  # Scenario Outline: PARAMETERIZED_SCENARIO
  #   Given INPUT_CONDITION with "<input>"
  #   When PROCESSING occurs
  #   Then OUTPUT should be "<expected>"
  #   And VALIDATION should pass
  #
  #   Examples:
  #     | input    | expected |
  #     | value1   | result1  |
  #     | value2   | result2  |
  #     | edge_val | edge_res |
  #
  # 7. Consider workflow scenarios:
  #    - Multi-step processes
  #    - State transitions
  #    - Integration between components
  #
  # 8. For Intelligence Interface specific scenarios:
  #    - Agent coordination and learning
  #    - Space-based computing
  #    - System evolution and self-improvement
  #    - Configuration-driven adaptation
  #    - Bootstrap compiler functionality
  #    - Golden repository integration
