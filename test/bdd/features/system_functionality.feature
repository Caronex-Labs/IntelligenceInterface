Feature: System Functionality Validation
  As a developer
  I want to validate that the Intelligence Interface system works correctly
  So that I can be confident in the foundation for future development

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface project at "/Users/caronex/Work/CaronexLabs/IntelligenceInterface"

  Scenario: Basic system operation validation
    Given the Intelligence Interface codebase
    When the system builds successfully
    And all tests pass
    Then the system should be ready for development

  Scenario: Configuration system testing  
    Given the system configuration framework
    When I load configuration from multiple sources
    Then configuration should cascade properly
    And environment variables should override defaults
    And project-specific config should be loaded correctly

  Scenario: Build and runtime functionality verification
    Given the complete codebase after migration
    When I build the system
    Then the build should complete without errors
    And all package dependencies should resolve correctly
    And the executable should be created successfully
