Feature: Caronex Manager Agent Implementation
  As a user of Intelligence Interface
  I want to interact with Caronex for system management and coordination
  So that I can plan implementations and coordinate agent activities efficiently

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface has a complete meta-system foundation
    And the configuration system supports Caronex agent specialization
    And the base agent framework is available for extension

  Scenario: Caronex manager agent creation and initialization
    Given the Intelligence Interface has a complete meta-system foundation
    When I create the Caronex manager agent extending the base agent framework
    Then Caronex should be properly configured as a specialized manager agent
    And Caronex should have manager-specific personality and capabilities
    And Caronex should integrate with the existing agent infrastructure
    And Caronex should have coordination-focused configuration settings
    And Caronex should be distinguishable from implementation agents

  Scenario: System coordination and introspection capabilities
    Given I am interacting with Caronex manager
    And the system has multiple agents available
    When I ask about system capabilities and current state
    Then Caronex should provide accurate system information
    And Caronex should list available agents and their specializations
    And Caronex should report current system configuration
    And Caronex should help plan implementation approaches
    And Caronex should coordinate with appropriate specialized agents

  Scenario: Manager vs implementer role distinction
    Given I request a specific implementation task
    And Caronex manager is available for coordination
    When I communicate with Caronex about the implementation
    Then Caronex should focus on planning and coordination
    And Caronex should not attempt direct implementation
    And Caronex should delegate to appropriate implementation agents
    And Caronex should provide clear task breakdown and coordination plans
    And Caronex should maintain clear boundaries between management and implementation

  Scenario: Agent lifecycle management and coordination
    Given Caronex needs to coordinate multiple agents for a complex task
    And the system has various specialized agents available
    When I request a multi-step implementation requiring agent coordination
    Then Caronex should identify appropriate agents for each step
    And Caronex should coordinate agent interactions and dependencies
    And Caronex should monitor progress and provide status updates
    And Caronex should handle agent communication protocols
    And Caronex should ensure task completion through proper delegation

  Scenario: Configuration and system evolution capabilities
    Given Caronex has access to system configuration and state
    And the meta-system supports evolution and improvement
    When I request system evolution or improvement suggestions
    Then Caronex should analyze current system capabilities
    And Caronex should provide evolution recommendations
    And Caronex should coordinate system improvement implementations
    And Caronex should maintain system stability during evolution
    And Caronex should support bootstrap compiler integration for self-improvement
