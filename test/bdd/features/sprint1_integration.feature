Feature: Sprint 1 Integration Validation
  As a Quality Assurance engineer
  I want comprehensive validation of Sprint 1 implementation
  So that the meta-system foundation is solid for future development

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface system is available
    And all Sprint 1 tasks have been completed
    And the meta-system foundation is established

  Scenario: Complete workflow validation
    Given the Sprint 1 implementation is complete
    When I test the full user workflow from system initialization to coordination
    Then all existing functionality should work as before
    And Caronex manager mode should be fully functional
    And mode switching should be seamless and intuitive
    And system should provide clear feedback for all operations
    And performance should meet baseline expectations

  Scenario: Architecture foundation validation
    Given the new directory structure and agent system
    When I validate the foundation for future space management
    Then the architecture should support space-based computing concepts
    And agent coordination patterns should be established
    And configuration system should support meta-system requirements
    And all package migrations should be complete and functional

  Scenario: BDD compliance validation
    Given all Sprint 1 tasks with BDD scenarios
    When I run the complete BDD test suite
    Then all task-specific scenarios should pass
    And test infrastructure should be robust and reliable
    And BDD patterns should be established for future development
    And no test failures should occur across the entire suite

  Scenario: Performance and stability validation
    Given the complete Sprint 1 implementation
    When I stress-test the system under various conditions
    Then performance should meet or exceed baseline expectations
    And system should be stable under normal and edge case usage
    And memory usage should be within acceptable limits
    And concurrent access should work without issues

  Scenario: Documentation completeness validation
    Given the need for comprehensive project documentation
    When I review all documentation and memory files
    Then architecture documentation should be complete and accurate
    And user documentation should cover all new functionality
    And development documentation should support future work
    And memory bank should be synchronized with current state

  Scenario: Technical debt resolution validation
    Given the Sprint 1 technical debt management process
    When I review the technical debt status
    Then all Sprint 1 technical debt should be resolved
    And technical debt tracking should be comprehensive
    And quality standards should be maintained
    And no new technical debt should be introduced

  Scenario: Caronex manager coordination validation
    Given the Caronex manager agent implementation
    When I test the coordination capabilities
    Then system introspection should work correctly
    And agent coordination should function properly
    And management tools should provide accurate information
    And planning and delegation should be effective

  Scenario: TUI integration validation
    Given the TUI Caronex integration
    When I test the user interface functionality
    Then mode switching with Ctrl+M should work seamlessly
    And visual distinction should be clear and consistent
    And context management should preserve conversation history
    And performance should be responsive and efficient

  Scenario: Meta-system foundation readiness
    Given the complete Sprint 1 foundation
    When I assess readiness for future development
    Then space-based computing architecture should be prepared
    And agent-everything patterns should be established
    And bootstrap compiler foundation should be ready
    And configuration evolution should be supported
