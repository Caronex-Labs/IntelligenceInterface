Feature: Git Repository Initialization
  As a developer working on Intelligence Interface
  I want proper version control for the project
  So that I can track changes and maintain development history

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface project at "/Users/caronex/Work/CaronexLabs/IntelligenceInterface"

  Scenario: Initialize git repository
    Given the project directory exists without git tracking
    When I initialize the git repository
    Then git should be properly configured
    And initial commit should capture current project state
    And future changes should be trackable

  Scenario: Establish development workflow
    Given the git repository is initialized
    When I make changes to the codebase
    Then I should be able to commit changes with descriptive messages
    And I should be able to track development progress
    And I should have rollback capability if needed
