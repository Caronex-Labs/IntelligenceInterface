Feature: Meta-System Configuration Foundation
  As a system architect
  I want configuration support for meta-system concepts
  So that Caronex, spaces, and specialized agents can be properly configured

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface project at "/Users/caronex/Work/CaronexLabs/IntelligenceInterface"
    And the existing configuration system in internal/core/config/
    And the comprehensive BDD testing infrastructure is established
    And all test configuration issues have been resolved

  Scenario: Caronex agent configuration support
    Given the existing agent configuration system
    When I add Caronex agent type to the configuration
    Then Caronex should be configurable like other agents
    And manager-specific settings should be available
    And coordination capabilities should be configurable
    And configuration validation should include Caronex parameters

  Scenario: Space configuration foundation establishment
    Given the need for persistent desktop environments
    When I add space configuration types
    Then space definitions should support UI layout configuration
    And agent assignment to spaces should be possible
    And space persistence should be configurable
    And space-to-agent mapping should be supported

  Scenario: Agent specialization configuration enhancement
    Given the existing agent types (coder, summarizer, title, task)
    When I extend agent configuration for specialization
    Then specialized agent parameters should be configurable
    And agent coordination settings should be available
    And agent learning configuration should be supported
    And meta-system evolution settings should be configurable

  Scenario: Configuration validation and compatibility
    Given the extended configuration schema
    When configuration files are loaded
    Then all new configuration options should validate correctly
    And backward compatibility with existing configs should be maintained
    And configuration errors should provide clear guidance
    And default values should support meta-system functionality

  Scenario: Configuration evolution and migration
    Given existing Intelligence Interface configuration files
    When the system loads configurations with new meta-system options
    Then configurations should migrate seamlessly
    And new options should have sensible defaults
    And configuration schema should support future evolution
    And migration should be reversible and safe
