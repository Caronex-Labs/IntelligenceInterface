Feature: Caronex Management Tools
  As Caronex manager agent
  I want basic tools to understand and coordinate system state
  So that I can provide accurate information and effective coordination

  Background:
    Given I am Caronex with access to management tools
    And the Intelligence Interface system is running
    And the configuration is properly loaded

  Scenario: System state introspection
    Given I am Caronex with access to management tools
    When I need to assess current system capabilities
    Then I should be able to query available agents and their specializations
    And I should be able to check current configuration state
    And I should be able to report system status accurately

  Scenario: Basic coordination capabilities
    Given I need to coordinate agent activities
    When I assess implementation requirements
    Then I should be able to identify appropriate specialist agents
    And I should be able to provide planning guidance
    And I should be able to delegate implementation tasks appropriately

  Scenario: Configuration management
    Given I need to understand system configuration
    When I query configuration state
    Then I should be able to retrieve current configuration values
    And I should be able to validate configuration consistency
    And I should be able to report configuration issues if any exist

  Scenario: Agent lifecycle management
    Given I need to coordinate agent activities
    When I manage agent operations
    Then I should be able to list available agent types
    And I should be able to check agent readiness status
    And I should be able to coordinate agent task delegation

  Scenario: Space foundation introspection
    Given the foundation for space management exists
    When I query space-related capabilities
    Then I should be able to list basic space configuration options
    And I should be able to report space readiness status
    And I should be able to provide guidance for future space implementation
