Feature: Directory Structure Migration
  As a developer working on Intelligence Interface
  I want the codebase organized for meta-system architecture
  So that future space and agent implementations have proper foundation

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface project at "/Users/caronex/Work/CaronexLabs/IntelligenceInterface"

  Scenario: Preserve existing functionality during migration
    Given the current Intelligence Interface structure with working TUI and agents
    When I migrate to the new directory structure
    Then all existing functionality should continue working
    And build processes should remain intact
    And all tests pass

  Scenario: Establish meta-system organization
    Given the new directory structure requirements
    When I organize code into caronex/, agents/, spaces/, tools/
    Then code should be logically separated by meta-system concerns
    And Caronex manager should have dedicated directory
    And foundation for user spaces should be established

  Scenario: Architecture foundation validation
    Given the system has meta-system architecture support
    When I validate the architecture foundation
    Then the architecture should support future evolution
    And space-based computing should be possible
    And agent coordination patterns should be established
