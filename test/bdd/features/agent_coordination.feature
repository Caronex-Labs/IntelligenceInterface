Feature: Agent Coordination Testing
  As the Caronex orchestrator
  I want to coordinate multiple agents effectively
  So that complex tasks can be completed through agent collaboration

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface system with agent capabilities
    And multiple specialized agents are available

  Scenario: Multi-agent task coordination
    Given agents [coder, summarizer, task] are available
    And they have specific capabilities
    When complex task is requested
    Then Caronex should coordinate the agents
    And each agent should work in appropriate space
    And agents should communicate effectively
    And the result should meet requirements
    And coordination patterns should be learned

  Scenario: Agent learning and adaptation
    Given a coder agent has generated code multiple times
    When the generated code consistently follows certain patterns
    And the patterns result in successful outcomes
    Then the agent should recognize these patterns
    And the agent should apply similar patterns to new requests
    And the agent should improve code generation quality

  Scenario: Dynamic agent spawning
    Given the system has base agent capabilities
    When a new specialized task type is encountered
    Then the system should spawn appropriate specialist agents
    And the new agents should be configured correctly
    And the agents should integrate with existing coordination
    And the system should track new agent performance

  Scenario: Agent failure and recovery
    Given a multi-agent workflow is in progress
    When one agent fails during execution
    Then the system should detect the failure
    And the system should recover gracefully
    And the workflow should continue with alternative approaches
    And failure patterns should be learned for prevention

  Scenario: Cross-agent knowledge sharing
    Given multiple agents have learned different patterns
    When knowledge sharing is triggered
    Then agents should share successful patterns
    And shared knowledge should be validated
    And knowledge conflicts should be resolved
    And collective intelligence should improve
