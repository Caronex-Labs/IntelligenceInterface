Feature: Meta-System Evolution Testing
  As the Intelligence Interface system
  I want to test my ability to evolve and improve
  So that I can validate self-evolution capabilities

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface meta-system is operational
    And the system has evolution capabilities enabled

  Scenario: System self-modification validation
    Given the system has current architecture
    And the system detects improvement opportunity
    When evolution trigger occurs
    Then the system should safely modify itself
    And the system should validate changes
    And the system should maintain compatibility
    And the system should be able to rollback

  Scenario: Bootstrap compiler functionality
    Given the system needs to generate code to improve itself
    When the bootstrap compiler is triggered
    Then it should generate improved code
    And it should test the code in isolation
    And it should integrate the code safely
    And it should update system documentation
    And it should contribute patterns to golden repository

  Scenario: Agent evolution patterns
    Given an agent has learned from experience
    When the agent applies learning to new scenarios
    Then the agent should demonstrate improved performance
    And the agent should retain successful patterns
    And the agent should adapt to context variations
    And the agent should share knowledge with other agents

  Scenario: Space-based computing validation
    Given the system supports space-based architecture
    When I create and manage dynamic spaces
    Then spaces should be isolated from each other
    And spaces should communicate through controlled channels
    And spaces should be able to evolve independently
    And resource allocation should be managed efficiently

  Scenario: Configuration evolution testing
    Given the system has a current configuration
    When configuration changes are needed for evolution
    Then the system should evolve configuration safely
    And backward compatibility should be maintained
    And configuration validation should work correctly
    And hot reloading should function properly
