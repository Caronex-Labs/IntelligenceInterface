Feature: BDD Testing Infrastructure
  As a development team
  I want comprehensive BDD testing infrastructure
  So that all future development follows test-driven patterns

  Background:
    Given the Intelligence Interface project at "/Users/caronex/Work/CaronexLabs/IntelligenceInterface"
    And the project has existing Go testing infrastructure with testify
    And there are currently package naming conflicts causing test failures
    And test configuration issues prevent proper test execution

  Scenario: Test infrastructure reliability
    Given the Intelligence Interface codebase
    When I run the complete test suite
    Then all existing tests should pass without conflicts
    And package naming should be consistent throughout the codebase
    And test configuration should work properly for all components

  Scenario: Package naming conflict resolution
    Given package conflicts in internal/agents/base and internal/tools/builtin
    When I fix the package declarations to be consistent
    Then internal/agents/base should use 'base' package throughout
    And internal/tools/builtin should use 'builtin' package throughout
    And all imports should reference the correct package names
    And the system builds successfully

  Scenario: Test configuration issues resolution
    Given test failures TD-2025-06-15-002 and TD-2025-06-15-003
    When I implement proper test configuration setup
    Then LLM prompt tests should run with mock provider configuration
    And tools tests should run with proper config dependency injection
    And all test configuration dependencies should be resolved

  Scenario: BDD framework integration
    Given the project needs BDD testing capabilities
    When I integrate Godog BDD framework
    Then I should be able to write Gherkin scenarios
    And step definitions should execute properly
    And BDD tests should integrate with existing test suite
    And BDD test runner should work alongside unit tests

  Scenario: Sprint 1 scenario validation
    Given the completed Sprint 1 tasks (Tasks 1 and 1.5)
    When I implement their BDD scenarios as executable tests
    Then directory migration scenarios should pass
    And git initialization scenarios should pass
    And system functionality should be validated through BDD tests
    And all Sprint 1 acceptance criteria should be testable
